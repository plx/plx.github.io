# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Jekyll-based GitHub Pages site with a blog structure. The site uses the jekyll-theme-dinky theme and is configured for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Key Commands

### Local Development

The repository now includes a Gemfile and justfile for convenient local development:

1. **Initial setup** (one-time):
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies to vendor/bundle (avoids sudo requirements)
   bundle install --path vendor/bundle
   ```

2. **Development commands** (via justfile):
   ```bash
   # Start Jekyll server for preview (default port 4000)
   just preview
   
   # Start server and open in browser
   just view
   
   # Stop the server
   just shutdown
   
   # Open browser if server is already running
   just open
   
   # Use custom port (all commands accept port argument)
   just view 8080
   just shutdown 8080
   ```

3. **Direct Jekyll commands** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Run Jekyll server manually
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   
   # Build site without serving
   bundle exec jekyll build
   ```

4. **GitHub Pages deployment**: Push changes to the main branch and GitHub Pages will automatically build and deploy

Note: The vendor/ directory is excluded from Jekyll builds via _config.yml to prevent processing of gem files.

### Creating New Posts

Create new blog posts in the `_posts/` directory with the naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-dashes.md
```

Posts should include front matter with:
- layout: post
- title: "Post Title"
- date: YYYY-MM-DD
- description: "Brief description"
- tags: [tag1, tag2]

### Creating New Notes

Create new notes in the `_notes/` directory with any filename ending in `.md`.

Notes should include front matter with:
- title: "Note Title"
- description: "Brief description"

Notes are displayed alphabetically by title and do not support dates or tags.

### Testing and QA

The repository has Playwright browser automation available via MCP for testing and QA purposes. This enables:
- Visual testing and screenshot capture
- Navigation testing
- Content verification
- Browser automation tasks

Note: the project has a dedicated QA-via-playwright agent named "web-qa-playwright".

## Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `_posts/`: Blog posts in Markdown format (time-based articles)
- `_notes/`: Notes in Markdown format (living documents without dates/tags)
- `_layouts/`: Page templates (default, page, post)
- `_includes/`: Reusable components (sidebar.html with mobile hamburger menu, tag-link.html)
- `assets/css/`: Custom stylesheets (custom.css for sidebar and mobile responsive layout)
- `index.md`: Homepage showing recent articles
- `tags.md`: Tag listing page
- `notes.md`: Notes listing page
- `about.md`: About page (includes site attribution)

### Key Technical Details
- **Theme**: jekyll-theme-dinky (GitHub Pages theme)
- **Markdown processor**: kramdown with GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
- **Navigation**: 
  - Desktop: Fixed sidebar navigation
  - Mobile: Hamburger menu with full-width sliding panel (pure CSS, no JavaScript)
  - Breakpoint: 768px
- **Collections**: 
  - Posts: Time-based articles with dates and tags
  - Notes: Living documents without dates or tags
- **Permalink structure**: 
  - Posts: `/:year/:month/:day/:title/`
  - Notes: `/notes/:title/`
- **Default layouts**: Posts use "post" layout, pages and notes use "page" layout
- **Attribution**: Site attribution (GitHub Pages, Dinky theme) is located on the About page

### Content Flow
1. Posts and notes are written in Markdown with YAML front matter
2. Jekyll processes content through the specified layouts
3. The sidebar navigation (sidebar.html) provides site-wide navigation:
   - Posts link leads to homepage showing all posts
   - Tags link shows all tags used in posts
   - Notes link shows all notes with sub-navigation
   - About link shows the about page
4. The homepage (index.md) displays all posts with their metadata
5. The notes page (notes.md) displays all notes alphabetically by title
6. Tags are extracted from posts and displayed via the tag-link.html include
7. GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys on push to main branch

### Mobile Navigation Implementation

The site features a responsive navigation system that adapts to mobile devices:

#### Desktop (> 768px)
- Fixed sidebar on the left with full navigation menu
- Site title, description, and navigation links always visible
- 200px fixed width sidebar

#### Mobile (â‰¤ 768px)
- Collapsed header showing only "Dispatches" and hamburger menu icon
- Full-width sliding menu panel activated by hamburger click
- Pure CSS implementation using checkbox input for state management
- No JavaScript required (compatible with GitHub Pages restrictions)

#### Key Implementation Details
- **Hamburger menu structure**: Hidden checkbox (`#menu-toggle`) + label with three-line icon
- **Animation**: CSS transforms for smooth sliding and hamburger-to-X transition
- **State management**: CSS `:checked` pseudo-class controls menu visibility
- **Menu positioning**: Uses `transform: translateX(-100%)` with `visibility: hidden` for reliable hiding

### CSS Lessons Learned

When implementing mobile navigation, several CSS challenges were encountered and solved:

1. **Element Hiding Best Practices**
   - **Issue**: Using negative `left` positioning (e.g., `left: -100%`) can leave partial elements visible
   - **Solution**: Use `transform: translateX(-100%)` combined with `visibility: hidden` for complete hiding
   - **Why**: Transform moves the element visually while visibility ensures it's not interactable

2. **Mobile Layout Gotchas**
   - **Issue**: Flex layouts can cause unexpected spacing on mobile
   - **Solution**: Change wrapper to `display: block` on mobile breakpoints
   - **Why**: Removes flex-related spacing issues

3. **Z-Index and Positioning**
   - Mobile header needs proper z-index stacking (1000+) to stay above content
   - Fixed positioning requires careful height calculations for content padding
   - Use `overflow: visible` on containers to allow menus to extend beyond

4. **Debugging Overlapping Elements**
   - Browser developer tools are essential for identifying which specific element is causing overlap
   - Check both the container and child elements for positioning issues
   - Sometimes the issue is inherited padding/margin rather than the obvious element

5. **Full-Width Mobile Menus**
   - Set menu width to 100% for better mobile readability
   - Ensure no parent containers constrain the width
   - Test on actual mobile devices or browser mobile emulation
