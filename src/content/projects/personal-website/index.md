This is my personal website, built with Astro.

It's a work in progress, and I'm always looking for feedback.

## Why Astro (and Why Vibe-Coding)?

I chose Astro because I couldn't find a satisfactory off-the-shelf platform or package that met my full criteria:

- easy to host / simple to secure[^1]
- acceptable overall aesthetics 
- easy import of existing markdown (e.g. "no new markup/dialect")
- reasonably-flexible "information architecture"
- high-quality accessibility support[^2]

[^1]: In practice, this means either "paid blogging sytem" or "static site generator".

[^2]: Carrying over from my iOS work, I'm a big believer in the importance of accessibility. In particular, I think *implementing* it is good for users, and *contemplating* it is beneficial for developers—helps with really thinking-through a data model.

After some research, I couldn't find anything open source that met all of the above out-of-the-box;
I also looked at commercial offerings, but none ticked all the boxes, either.

At that point, I settled on using a static site generator to build my site, and thought it'd be a good learning experience to vibe-code something small-but-real in an unfamiliar platform. 

After evaluating "name brand" platforms like Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby, I decided to go with Astro because of its support for MDX. More precisely, while reviewing static-site generators, I learned of MDX while reading up on Astro, thought it was cool, and that settled it—especially once I saw Astro had an actively-maintained suite of accessibility extensions.

That's the story here, and why I settled on Astro. 

So far I'd say Astro has mostly lived up to my hopes; I'm not informed-enough to judge it in context, but so far I don't think Astro-qua-Astro has been limiting in any way...but the vibe-coding experience has been very mixed.

## Vibe-Coding: Early Post-Mortem

The tl;dr here is: I made *four* independent attempts to vibe-code this site from scratch, *none of which* succeeded; I finally succeeded by *vibe-editing* an existing template, but only after I'd learnt just enough Astro to see how the template worked.
