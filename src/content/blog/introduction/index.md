[Dispatches](../index.md) is a place for publishing my technical writing. During this initial phase much of the content will "refurbished-and-expanded": taking older personal notes or explanations, updating their content vis-a-vis subsequent developments, and then expanding them for accessibility.

Most of the topics will be related to software development, with a particular focus on Swift, lower-level iOS work, and—as of late—agentic coding assistants.

I have been working on a more-modern site and hope to migrate this content there once it's ready; until then, however, this is the place to look.
